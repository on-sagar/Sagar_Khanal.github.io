On 2022 November, the team at [Kathmandu Geo Lab](https://www.instagram.com/ktmgeolab/) organized an earthquake education campaign focoused on disseminating earthquake information, early preparedness tips and post-earthquake advice to primary level students and teachers in 4 schools across the Kathmandu valley. The work was targeted at children who had not experience the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake. Students from diverse engineering backgrounds came together and trained from industry experts and collaborated with organizations like the US Fulbright Office, NSET to make this campagin come to life. 

The effort is documented in a Nepali nationaly daily The Rising Nepal by Dr. Rachael Lau. Click [here](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/back-to-classroom-for-earthquake-preparedness) to see the full article.

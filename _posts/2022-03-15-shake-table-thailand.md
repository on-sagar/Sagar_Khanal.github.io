### SUMMARY
After our success at the Shake Table competition at CESS-NEPAL 2022, another opportuntiy came  to light. There came news of a International Shake Table Competition held at the Asian institute of Technlogy, Thailand and supported by Copmuters and Structures Inc. (CSI) itself. After securing sources from campus, university and getting a travel grant from CSI itself, the dream finally came true. We represented Nepal at an International Shake Table Competition and even became the runner ups beating teams from reputed universities like University of Malaya, NED Pakistan and so on.

### THE COMPETITION

The rules of the competition were fairly simple. Given a paritcular height and loding on a structure, the different competiting structures were tested against a sweeping signal incremental in both frequency and amplitude. The one to last the longest and the furthest in the roudns tested was to be declared the winner. Read about the rules in more detail here.

The assembly of the structure and details structural drawings are as follows:

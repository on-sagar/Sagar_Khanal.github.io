### SUMMARY

In countries like Nepal, where funding for experimental project is very less to non-existant, there is a gap to be fulfilled for introducing low cast experimental setups that provide that missing experimental/simulating experience to college level students. In this context, me and my group of friends (being crazily interested in seismic stuff) decided in our final semesters to fabricate a low cost shaketable that would fulfill the above objectives. The final result was even better than what we intitally had in mind.We organized the first ever National level Shake Table competition using the table, got funded from Commputers and Structures Inc. (CSI) Bangkok and made it a valuable addition to the earthquake engineering classes courtesy of Assoc. Prof. Dr. Kshitij C. Shrestha (used for demonstrations to both bachelors and masters level students). Scroll down to read more.

The Table is made up of plywood to decrease overall cost and is driven by a simple scooter motor to drive the uniaxial harmonic motion of the table. The Amplitudes can be varied from 1 cm, 2.5 cm upto 5 cm with maximum frequency upto 5 Hz and can easily support weight upto 25 Kgs without any notable deflections. The Table's frequency is controlled by the input voltage to the driving motor. The Table was further calibrated using KS48C High Sensitivity Accelerometer.

### LEARNING PROCESS
The Shake Table was immensly helpful for furthering our learning in structural dynamics. We used Bamboo sticks used in Stick food (sausafe sticks to be exact) and used hot glue to make our structures. The structures were fairly light very and had very less damping.

We mainly observed stiffness degradation due to incremental excitaion by studying the free vibration respones after each excitation.

### SHAKE TABLE COMPETITION AT CESS-2022
The Shake Table competition at CESS-2022 was first of its kind. 20 Teams participated in the competition. All the teams were provided the base excitation and the order in which they would be excited.

### INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPATION

After we organized the shake table competition at CESS 2022 in our campus, we got the opportunity to take part in an international shake table competition organized at Asian institute of technology by Computers and Structures Inc. (CSI). Read my blog to know more about this unique experience.

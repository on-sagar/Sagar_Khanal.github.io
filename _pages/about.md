Hey you! I am a B.E. Civil Engineering graduate from IOE Pulchowk Campus and I am currently working as a research assistant at the Department of Civil Engineering under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof Dr. Kshitij C. Shrestha](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=jLMJr90AAAAJ&hl=en). My current research here involves reliability studies and reviewing Steel construction specifications and code of practices to develop a new steel code for Nepal.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in research in the intersection of natural hazards and the built environment spanning across earthquake engineering, data science and disaster risk reduction.

When I am not studying, I like to binging movies, playing football and reading newspapers. Please feel free to hop around and know more about me!
